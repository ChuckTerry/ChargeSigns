# ChargeSigns

| Notice |
|-----|
|This plug-in is now obsolete and anyone is welcome to pick up development.  Considering the downfall of Bukkit, I would highly recommend developing the plug-in for [Spigot}(https://www.spigotmc.org/) if someone picks up development.|

This Plug-in's original purpose was to charge players money to place signs based on the text on the sign.  It could be used, for example, to charge a player to lock a chest (by detecting [Lockette] on the first line).
